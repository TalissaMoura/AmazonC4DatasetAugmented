Is not exfoliating at all, and doesn't really lather that great, which is why I didn't give it the full five stars, but works well regardless. It rinsed off my face easily, something I appreciate. A few other cleansers seem to never fully rinse, even with a washcloth, and I hate that. This does what I need it to do without any adverse side affects, and my skin seems to be doing well with it.\",\"Nice  brushes, I love them but my daughter thinks they are pokey. They do help remove tangled hair but still use a finning brush too.\",\"I go to the dentist every three months due to plaque buildup and this tool has helped me to control plaque in between visits.  Very sharp so you do have to be very careful when using it.  Vibration helps to break up the plaque which I can then floss and brush away.\",\"I wouldn’t say that this gives the feeling of just getting your teeth professional cleaned, but it does seem to work on surface plaque buildup. I personally can’t stand the way it feels on my teeth. It’s a really uncomfortable sensation.\",\"While the mask was a tiny bit small compared to most brands I have tried, it had plenty of serum and left my skin looking and feeling very hydrated and soothed. I knew it has tea tree oil in it, which I love, but it was slightly too tingly for me to have on for 20min. and I had to take it off a little sooner. It didn’t harm my skin in any way, but I don’t love the tingles.<br />I do love the cellulose material of this mask, it’s so much better for the environment!\",...,\"Smells nice but only for the right man at the right place. It's a sophisticated, classy upscale scent. A blue collar worker or teenage Abercrombie/Hollister, Yeti Cooler and light bar kind of guy couldn't pull it off (Stick with Polo Red or Abercrombie Fierce if you're in that category). It would confuse everyone. The kind of guy that pulls this cologne off is either in a suit, nice dress shirt and slacks or womanizer grandpa during the fall and winter. Never wear this in the summer or in a t-shirt, shorts and flip flops because my brain will hurt from the confusion. You can either say it smells like a sweet cigar or root-beer, both are valid descriptions for this scent. It lasts all day!\",\"SheModern sticky stamping polishes is a great purchase for me. As a beginner of stamping these polishes helps a lot to pick up the very fine details on the stamping plates. Will buy more colors as well as the sticky clear and sealer, soon.\",\"i like this.. I'm not sure it was worth the money as there are others like this on the market for much less..\",\"It’s a great brush, but it needs to be a tad bit tougher…. It combs, but when you need to get a tangle out, the bristles aren’t tough enough. I have to literally go get a different brush. This brush is very gentle. My daughter doesn’t complain…. But I need this to be just a bit stronger to get through the tangles. Not go get a different brush.\",\"Smells terrific and got it quickly in mail.

My skin feels a little more stripped than I would like it to feel. But at this price point, it's perfect. I'm just really spoiled with my skin care.<br /><br />Definitely appropriate for someone with oily skin.

I wear make-up when I work out so I need something that really cleans afterwards. this will do the trick.\",\"Mine smells like freshly cut grass and rubbing alcohol, which even after washed away you can still smell. It is very strong and medicinal. It is not my favorite. The jelly formula is awesome though, it cleans well and soothes the skin. I think this would work equally well on all skin types. There are little chunks of, I am assuming Cica leaves, but you cannot feel them at all. There is no exfoliating going on with this product.\",\"Very refreshing, cleans well without over drying my skin. Is not exfoliating at all, and doesn't really lather that great, which is why I didn't give it the full five stars, but works well regardless. It rinsed off my face easily, something I appreciate. A few other cleansers seem to never fully rinse, even with a washcloth, and I hate that.
